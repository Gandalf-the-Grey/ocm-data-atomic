      "Comment": "There is a major problem of non-electric cars using the four spaces provided. I have been in to customer services several times to point this out. Many of the people parking do not realize they are charging spaces, and I have suggested to Waitrose that they paint the spaces more prominently. I don't think my complaints get further than the customer services person though.\n\nRecently, one of two charging posts was out of action. I reported the fault to Chargemaster, but since repair the charger operates only at 3kw - it does not give the usual option of waiting for a fast, 7kw, charge. It seems to have been downgraded. Since the maximum parking in this car park is 2 hours, 3kw is not very useful.\n\nTrouble is, it seems churlish to complain when Waitrose are troubling to provide charging in the first place.",
